            <h3>A FEW GUIDELINES TO BE OBSERVED </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It should be the earnest responsibility of parents to ensure that their children attend school punctually, are regular and disciplined in their academic work and progress.</li>
                <li>If parents observe that their child has not been assigned homework for sometime, or is not able to follow the lessons, the Principal should be contacted.</li>
                <li>Private Tuitions are discouraged. Class teachers and subject teachers will not be allowed to tutor students on a private arrangement.</li>
                <li>Bullying or use of foul language will invite disciplinary action and will be dealt with severely.</li>
                <li>Students are to be within the school campus by 8.30 am. Late comers will be sent home. Late comers are to get their late-coming record signed by the teacher in-charge and attested by the parents.</li>
                <li>Parents/guardian will not be allowed to feed children during the lunch break. Parents are not to bring/ send tiffin or books to their wards in-between the school hours. Lunch/ snacks should be carried by the children.</li>
                <li>Students are to report to school in freshly laundered uniforms, with clean socks and shoes. Girls should come with neatly plaited hair and should use only black rubber bands/hair bands.</li>
                <li>Students found tampering with school records and marks allotted in tests or examinations are liable to face strict disciplinary action.</li>
            </ul>                    
            <h3>LEAVE RULES</h3>
            <h6>Punctuality and regular attendance is insisted upon</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>It is compulsory for students to complete 85% attendance every semester to make them eligible for the semester exams.</li>
                <li>Repeated absence without leave or unexplained absence for more than two weeks at a stretch without prior permission from the Principal will be viewed as tantamount to the student having left the school.</li>
                <li>A note of excuse signed by the parent or guardian and a medical certificate in case of illness should be furnished.</li>
                <li>Leave will not be granted on the days of tests/ examinations. No retest will be conducted.</li>
                <li>Children are expected to attend school on the last working day and on reopening day after every vacation. Those absent because of sickness, must present medical certificate before joining the class.</li>
                <li>Parents are requested to fix their program for leaving town or going on a holiday in such a way as to coincide with the holidays of the school. Children will not be allowed to leave school early in order to catch a train/ bus/ flight or go on a journey or attend a function.</li>
